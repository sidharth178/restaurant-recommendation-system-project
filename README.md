# restaurant-recommendation-system-project

Restaurant recommender system is a machine learning model.This blog is the part of capstone project in Udacity Nanodegree Program.The overview of this project is to recommend restaurants based on userâ€™s likes and dislikes and his previous interest data.

### Library used

1. numpy
2. sklearn
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. pandas

### Exploratory analysis:

Scrapping the data from different sources and then combining it to form a single-ton dataset is a difficult task. To do so, we need to explore the current state of dataset and then list up all the features needed to be fetched.Exploring the dataset is important because it gives you initial insights and may help you to get partial idea of the answers that you are looking to find out from the data. While exploring the dataset, I found out that Inderanagar has most number of venues while Varthur has the least.

### Inferential analysis:

Most important factors while building the recommender system were population and income. They are the most import factor because they have a nonlinear relationship according to our dataset.It is possible to have less number of people and more income and vice versa. 

The result of the recommender system is that it produces a list of top restaurants and the most common venue item that the user can enjoy.
